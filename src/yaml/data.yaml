summary:
  description: |
    I am a software engineer engaged in the development of public cloud services at NTT Communications.
  details:
    - - My primary focus is on developing the backend of cloud services.
      - - I design and implement REST APIs to provide networks and servers as a service, asynchronous processes for building and configuring these resources on the infrastructure, and monitoring systems to collect metrics for users.
        - I have experience in designing the architecture of backends, establishing CI/CD pipelines, and migrating the infrastructure from virtual servers on-premises to Kubernetes on the cloud service.
    - - In the team, I take on the role of Tech Lead or Scrum Master.
      - - I can contribute to decision-making and problem-solving in the team by deciding design with a focus on sustainability and extensibility, managing schedules and breaking down tasks.
        - I can also contribute to enhancing service value and quality by collaborating with product and operation teams to define service specifications, and by cooperating with other microservice teams and the SRE team.

                  - - Backend Development using Python (Tornado)
                    - - Designed and implemented REST APIs to provide self-managed firewalls and fully-managed load balancers.
                      - Designed and implemented asynchronous processes to build network products (e.g., vSRX) on virtual servers and configure them via REST APIs.
                      - Designed and implemented monitoring systems to collect metrics from network products (e.g., vSRX) via REST APIs and SNMP.
                  - - CI / CD Pipeline Management
                    - - Set up CI pipelines to run pytest using Prow, and to execute linter or formatter (e.g., Ruff) using GitHub Actions.
                      - Set up CD pipelines for Blue / Green Deployment on Kubernetes using Argo Rollouts and Tekton.
                  - - Infrastructure Automation
                    - - Developed Ansible modules and playbooks to manage provider configurations by executing backend APIs.
                      - Developed Terraform providers for users to manage Firewall and Managed Load Balancer resources.
                  - - Documentation and Testing
                    - - Wrote API references using OpenAPI and implemented scenario tests using Postman.
